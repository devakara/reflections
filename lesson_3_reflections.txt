When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Using remote repository gives us freedom to add/modify our code from anywhere; also it will be help if multiple people are 
contributing to the same repo. Using local repo only means keeping our changes/code private.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
When multiple developers are working on the repo pushing their commits to remote, to keep the local repo up to date we need to 
pull changes from remote manually.

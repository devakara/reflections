What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When we initailize a repository .git (hidden) folder gets created, which contains metadata about the tracking
of files. git init is the command used to initialize a repository. This command doesn't commit anything yet, it
just puts in the information required to track any future commits to that folder.
git status command tells us the status of the current commit - tracked, untracked files, files modified from the
last commit.
'Initial commit' comment in the status log signifies that we still need to make the first commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is an intermediate area between working dir and repo; git add command adds the untracked files to staging
area and with a git commit command all the files in the staging area are committed to the repo. Files in staging area
are still not tracked.
